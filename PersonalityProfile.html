        		<h1>Personality Profile</h1>
				
				<p> The Following Personality And Learning tests were taken for This assignment.<p>
				
				<a href="https://www.myersbriggs.org">Myers-Briggs Test</a>
				<a href="http://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire/">VARK Learning Style Test</a>

				<h1>Myers-Briggs Test</h1>
				
				<p>The result from my Myers-Briggs test showed my personality type as; ISFP, Versatile Supporter<p>
				<p>After reading through the information about ISFP personality types I feel as though it is a good representation of my personality. At my best  I always try to keep a realistic mindset, Im dedicated and loyal to things I am passionate about and I hold strong to my ideals and values.
At my worst  I always feel as though there is too much going in my life to cope. I feel constrained for time and start to second guess myself.<p>
                <p>I think my personality type will help me in team situations. Being able to take the reins when a team needs to work together and get everyone cooperating. These are important traits needed for team work, especially in an online university environment where students in a group will need to work hard to coordinate and get together as a team.<p>
				<p>This can be taken into account when forming a team as I believe with my personality type and personal experience in previous university I have the skills and understanding needed to be able to lead a coordinated and function team that will work equally together.<p>
				
				
				<h1> Online Learning Test</h1>
				
				<p>The results for my online learning test showed that I am a very aural and hands on learner meaning I Learn better through listening to someone explain a concept or a task to me as well as learning through doing.<p>
				<p>To me hands on learning is the best way I absorb information. Having worked with  wood and metal for a lot of my life I have always learnt best by simply doing the task. In highschool I started making guitars. I still remember having no idea what I was doing nor did I understand the math involved with the task but with every guitar I made I learnt more and more about the precision involved with designing and making a body and neck mostly through trial and error. I remember reading about the math involved with placing a bridge and nut but it wasn't until I had put the math into practise on wood did I understand it.<p>
				<p> When it comes to taking this learning style into account when working with a team I believe it would be more beneficial for me and my team for me to be someone who documents our interactions, discussions and brainstorms.<p>
				
				
				<h1>Mixed Aptitude test</h1>
				<p>The results for my mixed aptitude test showed that I was competent with numerical and word problems, inductive reasoning and abstract reasoning but incompetant when it comes to numerical logic and I can struggle to understand concepts. I expected that I wouldn't do very well when it came to numeracy as it is one area I have always struggled with throughout highschool was mathematics. 
I think these aspects may hinder me in a team situation as I can sometimes struggle to absorb information or to completely understand concepts and ideas in a group environment as I tend to absorb information slowly and may need to recount something several times to fully understand it.<p>
