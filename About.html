        		<h1>About Me</h1>
				
				<p>Born and raised on the south coast of NSW. I am of aboriginal and Irish descent, my mother’s family being from the Wiradjuri mob and my Father being of Irish heritage.
I grew up in a town called batemans bay and I traveled around the state after highschool going from studying audio engineering in byron bay, living out the back of red rock mountain, to studying music in canberra.
Although i'm not as adventurous as i used to be and spend a lot of time with family at home, I still always set aside plenty of time for one of my greatest passions. As silly as it may sound, I love to get a few close friends together, pack up the suby and head up into the mountains searching for gold. </p>
    		
			
			<h1>My interest in IT</h1>
			
			<p>My interest in IT has always revolved around computers. When I was 7, we got our first computer at home which was amazing to me at the time as the school I attended had 50 students at the time and no computers besides what the teachers used. It was basically my first experience with the technology besides seeing computers in movies, I still remember not understanding how a mouse worked at the time.<p>
			<p>It wasn't until I was 12 that we got internet for the first time ever. I remember being so amazed with google and what you could do by searching something that I decided I wanted to work with computers and work for google when I was older. <p>
			<p>Since then I have always maintained a passion for computers and programming but never took it anywhere past being a hobby. I’ve worked in a few computer repair stores and did a bit of networking for my highschool but my interests slowly turned towards music for a long time until recently.<p>
		    
			
			
			
			<h1>Why I chose RMIT</h1>
			
			<p>I found two Universities on OUA that interested me. RMIT and The University of South Australia as they both had IT courses that interested me. Ultimately it was my partner who helped me decide as she started university this year and told me she had sussed out RMIT and UOSA as a potential universities for herself and in her opinion RMIT was the best choice because in her opinion RMIT offered the most student support and the lecturers she had met during an open day were very professional but also very passionate about teaching<p>
			
			
			
			
			<h1>What I hope to learn with RMIT</h1>
			
			<p>During my study time with RMIT I hope to learn not only about IT and programming and everything else this course entails as it’s one of my passions, but I also hope to learn how to manage my time properly and Learn how to set a schedule and keep it because for the last year I have had more and more time on my hands my productivity and time management skills have deteriorated.<p>
			
			
			
			
			<h1>Ideal Job opportunity</h1>
			
			<p>My ideal job would be something within the Data science/computer science Industry. As I have a passion to learn about these subjects and hope I can one day make it a career.<p>
			
			<img src="images/job.jpg">
			
			<p>This position is for a Mainframe Data scientist. Someone who analyzes data, creates algorithms and models data This position is appealing to me as it is the field I have always had a keen interest in.<p>
			<p>Data analytics is a very specialized field that requires a person to be able to solve complex algorithmic puzzles and analyze data on a level that many people do not understand. It requires at least a bachelor of Data analytics and a decent understanding of IT to get into.<p>
			<p>It is a hard profession that requires a lot of thinking and problem solving to be successful at and although I may not be anywhere near the level of specialization it takes to be a data scientist, I believe have great problem solving skills and a passion for learning what interests me and I believe that through this course, and possibly even a course in data analytics down the line. I can one day achieve what I have set out to do. <p>
