        		<h1>Joseph Moy-Byrne</h1>
				<img src="images/me.jpg">
				
				<p>Born and raised on the south coast of NSW. I am of aboriginal and Irish descent, my motherâ€™s family being from the Wiradjuri mob and my Father being of Irish heritage.
I grew up in a town called batemans bay and I traveled around the state after highschool going from studying audio engineering in byron bay, living out the back of red rock mountain, to studying music in canberra. Although i'm not as adventurous as i used to be and spend a lot of time with family at home, I still always set aside plenty of time for one of my greatest passions. As silly as it may sound, I love to get a few close friends together, pack up the suby and head up into the mountains searching for gold.
